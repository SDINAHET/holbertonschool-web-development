## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is part of the **Front-End Curriculum at Holberton School**. The objective is to build the **semantic HTML structure of a website** based on a Figma wireframe.

**No CSS or JavaScript** will be used at this stage — only semantic and valid HTML code following accessibility and best practices.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- ✅ What is HTML?
- ✅ How to create an HTML page from a wireframe
- ✅ What is a markup language?
- ✅ What is the DOM?
- ✅ What is an element/tag?
- ✅ What is an attribute?
- ✅ The purpose of each HTML tag

- HTML5 (Semantic tags only)
- [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) for code validation
- Figma for wireframe reference

> ⚠️ **No external libraries allowed** (e.g., Bootstrap, React, etc.)

---

## 🖼️ Figma Design

- [🌐 View Final Wireframe (Figma)](https://www.figma.com/file/3E02P6NmkAG0DzYlC1FuxG/HTML-Advanced?type=design&node-id=1-2)
- Make sure to **Duplicate to Drafts** in Figma to edit and inspect design details.

---

## 📝 Requirements

- ✅ Each file must end with a new line
- ✅ Use semantic HTML structure (header, main, section, article, footer, etc.)
- ✅ All HTML must pass the **W3C validator**
- ❌ No CSS, JavaScript, frameworks, or libraries allowed

---

## 🧪 Validation & QA

- HTML code must be W3C-compliant
- File: [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/)
- Submit for manual QA review on the Holberton platform once completed
